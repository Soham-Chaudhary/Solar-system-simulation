# 🌠 Solar System Simulation

An interactive 3D **Solar System Simulation** built with **Unity**, designed for exploration, learning, and real-time control of celestial motion.

🛠️ **Developed in just 3 days** during a hackathon challenge.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 **Planetary Cameras**  
  Switch between views of:
  - Every planet in the solar system  
  - The Moon (Earth’s satellite)  
  - Full system-wide camera for orbital overview

- 🛰️ **Interactive Planet Data**  
  A UI tab displays:
  - Planet name  
  - Scientific info like orbit speed, size, and distance (simplified)

- 🕹️ **Rotation Controls**
  - ⏯️ Pause/Play entire system motion  
  - 🔁 Control orbital speed: **1x, 2x, 4x**

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a solar system that is both educational and visually appealing
- Practice camera control, UI integration, and time scaling in Unity
- Deliver a complete working demo under a tight 3-day hackathon deadline

---

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- 🎥 **Multi-Camera Switching System**  
  Seamless transitions between planets and system view

- ⏱️ **Real-Time Simulation Speed Control**  
  Orbital motion is dynamically scaled using Unity’s `Time.timeScale`

- 🖱️ **Responsive UI**  
  Toggle planet data, speed controls, and camera options with intuitive interface

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Unity  
- **Language**: C#  
- **Platform**: PC (WebGL/Android build ready)  
- **Input**: Mouse, keyboard, or mobile touch

---

## 🧪 Learning Outcomes

- Improved understanding of Unity’s Transform hierarchy and orbital mechanics
- Learned to manage time scaling and system-wide animations
- Gained experience building a complete prototype under strict time pressure
